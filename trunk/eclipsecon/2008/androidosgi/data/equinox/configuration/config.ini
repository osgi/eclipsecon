# The comma-separated list of bundles which are automatically installed and optionally started
# once the system is up and running.  Each entry if of the form
#     <URL | simple bundle location>[@ [<startlevel>] [":start"]]
# If the startlevel is omitted then the framework will use the default start level for the bundle.
# If the "start" tag is added then the bundle will be marked as started after being installed.
# Simple bundle locations are interepreted as relative to the framework's parent directory.
# The startlevel indicates the OSGi start level at which the bundle should run.
